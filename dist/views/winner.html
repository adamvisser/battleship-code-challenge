		<h1>{{winner}} is Victorius!!</h1>
		<p>hopefully you enjoyed playing. I would really love to flesh this out and make it a lot better. I have a lot of problems with my current iteration....</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use of Magic numbers to set the board sizes</li>
			<li>use of an array when a range function wouldve worked in the for loop</li>
			<li>no graphics, just css classes</li>
			<li>the use of 4 arrays for the game boards, couldve been cleaned up with a ship object</li>
			<li>landing page is pretty boring</li>
			<li>instructions are soooooo boring</li>
			<li>my gulp script isnt copying over some of the needed css files</li>
			<li>I started this project from a copy pasta of another project, so probably have extra stuff around that isnt needed/used</li>
			<li>the function to take a shot for each player is the same thing (almost) twice</li>
			<li>it feels more like an app than a game itself</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Hopefully it gets the point across that I really like to learn, and I really try to use a framework to its advantage. I taught myself a lot of what I know about Angular, so hopefully yall can help me round out some of my rougher self taught edges.</p>
